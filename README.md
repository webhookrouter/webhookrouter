## 🔍 Why WebhookRouter?

Modern SaaS products, indie hackers and agencies rely on webhooks — from Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, Zapier and more.  
But:

- ❌ Failed destinations mean lost data  
- ❌ No central overview or history  
- ❌ Building retry, logging, and transformation is time-consuming

**WebhookRouter** solves that — fast, reliable, and privacy-friendly.

---

## ✨ Key Features (planned)

- ✅ Create custom webhook endpoints
- ✅ Forward to one or more destinations
- ✅ Transform payload (field mapping or stripping)
- ✅ Retry handling & delivery tracking
- ✅ Logging & manual replay
- ✅ Privacy-first (no third-party data sharing)
- ✅ Self-hosted and EU privacy-first SaaS option planned

---

## 📦 Tech Stack (planned)

- **Backend:** Go
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Svelte / Tailwind
- **Deployment:** Docker-based / Self-hosted possible
- **SaaS-Hosting:** Hetzner (EU)
